What has been reported as the largest refugee crisis since World War II has become a far-reaching humanitarian disaster threatening economies across Europe. This crisis includes rising inflation and shortages of food and other goods. Donor support is still needed for relief and recovery efforts, but that need will eventually shift to the long-term rebuilding of Ukraine's economy and infrastructure.

Over the years, however, its observation has caused much controversy.  In 1989, the first incarnation of Indigenous Peoples’ Day (First People’s Day or Native American Day, as it is also referred), was formally commemorated by the state of South Dakota. More states later followed. For some states and local communities, it is an alternative celebration without discounting one or the other.  In others, the holiday has replaced Columbus Day. Indigenous Peoples’ Day acknowledges the heritage and contributions of Indigenous People while recognizing and confronting the resilience of their communities as they continue to face institutionalized racial and social disparities. Like Indigenous Peoples’ Day, other important dates on the international, national, and local jurisdictional calendars include National Native American Heritage Month celebrated in November and International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples celebrated in August.
